<p>This repository houses the Django server component of our Gym and Diet Tracking Application, a powerful backend designed to support the comprehensive tracking of fitness and dietary progress. Built using Django, a high-level Python web framework, this server is engineered to provide robust data management, security, and scalability for the application.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<b>Robust Data Models</b>: Utilize Django's ORM to define and manage complex data models with ease. Our server handles a wide range of data, from user profiles and workout logs to dietary records and nutritional information.

<b>Secure Authentication</b>: Implement Django's built-in authentication system to manage user accounts securely. This includes features like password hashing, session management, and user permissions.

<b>API Endpoints</b>: Through the use of Django Rest Framework, the server offers RESTful API endpoints for the application's frontend to interact with. This includes endpoints for CRUD operations on workouts, meals, and diet plans.

<b>Admin Interface</b>: Leverage Django's automatically generated admin interface to manage application data. This powerful feature allows administrators to easily interact with the underlying database through a user-friendly web interface.

<h3>Technologies</h3>
The server is built exclusively with Django, taking full advantage of its features and its ecosystem:

<b>Django</b>: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

<b>Django Rest Framework</b>: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs, enabling the server to communicate with the frontend efficiently.
